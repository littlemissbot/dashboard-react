## Objective

Develop a dashboard application that allows users to create and manage multiple landing pages. The application should utilize client-side routing to navigate between different sections.

---

### Features

1. **Dashboard Home**

   - Display a list of existing landing pages with options to "Edit", "View", and "Delete".

2. **Landing Page Creation**

   - Implement a form to create a new landing page with a title, description, and a set of predefined components (Header, Footer, Text Block, Image).

3. **Landing Page Editor**

   - Use a separate route to edit each landing page.
   - Allow users to add, remove, and modify components on the landing page.

4. **Preview and Publish**

   - Add a "Preview" button in the editor to see the landing page's appearance.
   - Include a "Publish" option that changes the status of the landing page to "Live".

5. **View Landing Page**

   - Implement client-side routes to display the live landing pages.

6. **Authentication**

   - Implement a simple login page.
   - Protect the dashboard route, making it accessible only to authenticated users.

7. **Bonus: Analytics**
   - Add a section in the dashboard to show basic analytics like views and click-through rates for each landing page.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
